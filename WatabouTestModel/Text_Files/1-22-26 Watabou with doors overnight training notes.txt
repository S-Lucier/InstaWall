OVERNIGHT TRAINING RUN - 1/22/26
=================================

DATASET:
- Source: C:\Users\shini\UnetTinkering\data\watabou_final
- Training samples: 105 dungeon maps
- 3-class segmentation: walls (0), doors (127), floors (255)
- Door types filtered: only types 1, 5, 6, 7 marked as doors
- Grid size: 70px (hardcoded, some dungeons may have slight misalignment)

TRAINING CONFIG:
- Epochs: 1000 (fresh training, no checkpoint loaded)
- Checkpoint save interval: Every 50 epochs
- Learning rate: 1e-4
- Batch size: 4
- Image size: 512×512
- Device: CUDA (8GB VRAM)
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: BCEWithLogitsLoss

AUGMENTATIONS (AGGRESSIVE):
- RandomRotate90: p=1.0 (always apply)
- HorizontalFlip: p=0.7
- VerticalFlip: p=0.7
- RandomBrightnessContrast: brightness±25%, contrast±25%, p=0.6
- ColorJitter: brightness/contrast/saturation±15%, hue±8%, p=0.4
- GaussNoise: var_limit=(5, 20), p=0.2
- Blur: blur_limit=3, p=0.2

NOTES:
- Computer will hibernate automatically when training completes
- Checkpoints saved in: saved_models/checkpoint_epoch_X.pth.tar
- Validation predictions saved in: saved_predictions/
- Check validation Dice score progression to monitor 3-class performance

TRAINING STARTED:
- Successfully initialized: 105 train, 14 val samples
- Model parameters: 31,037,633
- Running in background, output logged to: training_output.log
- Expected completion: ~12-18 hours (1000 epochs)

TRAINING COMPLETED:
- All 1000 epochs finished successfully
- Final Validation Accuracy: 99.41%
- Final Validation Dice Score: 0.9869
- Checkpoints saved: every 50 epochs (50, 100, 150... 950, 1000)
- Final checkpoint: saved_models/checkpoint_epoch_1000.pth.tar
- Computer hibernation initiated after completion

BEST MODEL:
- Epoch 800: Validation Dice Score 0.9890 (HIGHEST)
- Model file: saved_models/checkpoint_epoch_800.pth.tar
- Use this checkpoint for inference/deployment
